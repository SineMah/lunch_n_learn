GraphQL
- What is ...
    - developed by Facebook
    - released in 2015
    - query language (& runtime) for APIs
    - API data includes complete description -> documentation by default
    - data fetching control
    - backwards compatible
    - multiple queries with one request, one endpoint
- REST vs GraphQL
    - GraphQL is more complex
    - GraphQL is typesafe (schemas)
    - data fetching control with GraphQL
    - easier data aggregation with GraphQL
    - REST has better error handling
    - Caching is easier with REST APIs
- GraphQL Limitations
    - heavy GraphQL queries can slow down your API
    - binary uploads ain’t GraphQL’s favourite
        - mutations with base64 encoded Blobs
        - mutations with a multipart HTTP requests
        - using a separate (REST) API ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    - keep track on your roles and scopes for each query not for each request since querying multiple queries with on request is common practice
